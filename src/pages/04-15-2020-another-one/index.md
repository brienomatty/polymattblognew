# Why politics is agile (article to write)

### Think while you’re writing like you think while you’re talking

The answer is no, I don’t think writing should precisely reflect a conversation. In fact, I’d highly recommend against it. See these transcripts from…(president, etc. Steven Pinker’s book).

What I’d like to impart though is that what we do well while talking it recall. I read a lot, and I think a lot, but my most active thinking is while trying to impress someone else in a conversation. I’m positive I’m not alone in this. Even at a company doing really difficult things, I bet that not all of your brainpower is reserved when speaking quaintly to the CEO. You take caution, and you want to sound smart. You think actively on your feet, getting better over time as you practice.

When writing, however, it’s common to simply leverage notes, and to forget. It’s a different process, mentally. There’s only a page and

It shouldn’t be that clean to start with. You need to edit yourself, but you can clarify afterwards.
