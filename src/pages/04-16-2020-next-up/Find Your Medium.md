# Find Your Medium

Three years ago, I cried for the first time since my dad died. It had already been more than five years since he passed away, and I was just then able to access the pain that I'd been letting build up inside me. It turned out to be one of the most beautiful days of my life — my mind, my heart, and my eyes all had uncoiled, providing an emotional and even physical release like I had never felt before.

I walked up and down the streets of Arlington, Virginia, slightly underdressed for this brisk, sunny day in **February**. My eyes continued to well up with tears as I walked, the plumpness of each tear inflating to its limit before bursting into scattered streams flowing from my upper cheek down, meeting at the bottom an open-mouthed smile as large as I could muster. These tears weren’t from sadness, at least not primarily. They were borne of relief — now I knew for certain that I had a way out of this mess, that “future” was a life tense I could reside in, maybe even happily. The life I could now live was one of emotional understanding and well-being, a life beyond the control of fear and worry and psychological paralysis that I had been living and grown increasingly weary of. In other words, my life was mine again, and I no longer feared further uncontrollable drowning or what could result from continuing to live my life at the bottom of a pit, because I now recognized that’s where I’d been — I had found it — and I would never return.

All of these realizations came as a result of my first therapy session. More accurately, it was the first session that actually worked for me. I had actually tried therapy years earlier, just a month or two after my dad passed away. Back then, I simply viewed attending therapy as a directional mandate, a box to check on the list of grieving over a loved one’s passing. I expected to check the box, then move on with my life. I was naive in thinking it would end there. I was naive in thinking I even had access to my emotions and resulting thoughts so soon after my world had been turned upside down. It was as though the season went from Summer to Blue — I had no chance making sense of it.

He died when I was in college, the summer before I started my junior year. I had just moved back home to help take care of him and be present for my family while my dad was undergoing cancer treatments. I was attending the University of North Carolina — Chapel Hill, and loved it, although I was a bit homesick. I moved back home, to Collegeville, Pennsylvania, transferring to Ursinus College, its campus only a 5-minute drive from home.

When school started back up that fall, I found myself attempting to check the “manage grief” box, working with a therapist on campus named Susan. Susan was a great ally for me, rooting for how I appeared to keep it together so shortly after tragedy struck. I was talking, which was good, but it was clear that my mind was on vacation, not fully comprehending what I was saying out loud. I distinctly remember leaving her office after my third visit, walking back to my car in the parking lot and thinking about how weird I felt. I felt confused, lightheaded, even a bit dizzy. There were no tears present, though I was concerned about what this was — I’d never felt this way before. I shrugged it off and continued toward my car. I didn’t tell anyone about it — I never did. I found my car in the lot, drove home, and never saw Susan again.

Five years later, this buildup of unmanaged fear and grief beat me down further and further into a gray blob of insignificance, my fear taking over my actions with each passing day. Everything had changed — fear had expanded to more and more areas of my life, but my life goals hadn’t, which resulted in the constant ball of stress I now embodied. I wanted to experience a richness of life, and yet I could barely hold down a job, yearning each and every day for the couch and TV, and the dark corner I to which I was compelled, and in which I built up a nest of comfort. I got good at knowing how to minimize my discomfort, knowing I couldn’t make it disappear. I was always terrified of the next moment, the one I’d lose control and everything in front of me would crumble. I was terrified of everything — I couldn’t stand the idea of my health degrading, and so I found myself in doctor’s offices on a near-weekly basis. I couldn’t even read the word “stroke” or “cancer” without assuming I would catch it like a dark spell upon the visual cue. Work was unbearable, sleep was inconceivable, and my self-confidence was draining quickly — the more I retreated emotionally, the tougher my relationships were tested, with friends, my family, and my girlfriend, but most importantly, with myself.

It was Saturday, and I was in DC, seeing a doctor about my heart. I had already done an EKG and stress tests, and was texting Jane that I would soon be on my way home. The Doctor walked back in, and did something I didn’t expect: she handed me a list of nearby therapists. She told me there was nothing wrong with my heart, but that sometimes pain can manifest from our psychologies. She knew I was taking a pill for anxiety to get to sleep every night, and generally had issues with anxiety that weren’t lessening. She was an M.D.- I always found this move difficult to understand, and I couldn’t be more grateful.

My car was parked just outside the office in Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C. I hopped in, started my car, and without much thought, I dialed one of the names on the list. I didn’t start at the top and make my way down, or look for the practice nearest my home; instead, I hurriedly let my eyes settle on the first words I could make out, a listing about two-thirds of the way down the sheet, and I began to dial.

Joy told me she was available to meet early this upcoming Monday. I told her I’d take it, not thinking of how I’d get out of work on such short notice. I decided afterward I would take a sick day. I *was* sick, after all. *This* was my last hope.

It only took a few minutes that Monday for me to reach a breaking point. But instead of resulting in intense anxiety, I balled my eyes out. I was in the middle of explaining my complicated background: I had a complicated relationship with my mother, three younger sisters relying on me for (at least the appearance of) stability, a misunderstood and under-decided identity, and, oh yeah, my dad passed away recently and I never really addressed it with myself. I detached myself from each and every one of these previously crippling thoughts, as Joy facilitated a waterfall of emotions pouring out of me. It was no bother that I was on a couch in a strange office, speaking with a woman I just met. I felt safe, and that’s the thing about being at your emotional and psychological depths — there’s nowhere else to go. I had decided for myself that even leading up to this moment, it couldn’t get worse. It *had* to come out, or I would certainly die. The tears didn’t stop —they were building up for years, after all. Angry tears, sad tears, confused tears, red tears, blue tears: they all escaped in a manic free-for-all, just as you imagine a dog feels seeing his master arrive home from active duty in theatre after years of loneliness and pain.

Joy stopped the meeting, and thanked me for coming by. At the very least, I was thinking now I had a place to come to and cry. The rest of that day was spent wandering, and wondering. Wandering about town, seeing things in plain view I hadn’t previously seen. Wondering about what this means for my life, and for Jane’s.

Years later, it feels strangely difficult to regain memories of the years leading up to meeting Joy for the first time. But that first session with her created a milestone for me — I set my stake in the earth again, and regained the clarity I needed. Just what was it that enabled me to heal this time? I’ve thought for years now about what had to happen

It was by no means the end to anxiety in my life, nor was it the only session needed for me to access the emotions I had and direct my life intentionally. It’s been nearly 3 years now, and I’m still seeing seeing Joy once per week. The conversations are very different now. The tears are infrequent, though when I’m overwhelmed, they do come. But now it’s healthy. I feel it, and I know *why*.

All of my experiences defending myself from this perpetual state of internal strife taught me to discover new defense mechanisms. I got really good at knowing what I needed and when, to preserve at least a calm presence externally. I took gum with me everywhere, thinking that if I became too anxious, I could take it out on the stick of gum and the person to whom I was speaking would be none the wiser. I also had a habit of making myself uncomfortable physically to substitute for my discomfort mentally — when driving mid-winter, I’d lower the windows when I noticed I was getting worked up…regardless of who else was in the car. I called out sick from work, and didn’t go anywhere I didn’t have to. I

(HMMMMM SO MANY DIFFERENT POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS — MAYBE I NEED TO SAVE SOME OF THIS AND NOT TELL THE FULL STORY????)

(MAYBE NOW I WEAVE BACK INTO PRESENT DAY TO KEEP THE READER ENGAGED — TIME TO DISCUSS JOY?? — THEN, I CAN GO BACK TO WRITING MY CREATIVE NONFICTION PIECE — AFTER THAT, I CAN DISCUSS WHAT IT MEANS TO ME TO HAVE FOUND A WAY TO VERBALLY EXPRESS MYSELF, TO GET PUSHED BY SOMEONE ELSE WHOM I RESPECTED, AND TALK ABOUT OTHER OPTIONS THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY WORK FOR OTHER PEOPLE — THE KEY THING IS TO KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU NEED TO ACCESS YOUR EMOTIONS, PERIOD. THERE IS NO ESCAPING KNOWING YOURSELF, KNOWING A WHY BUT NOT TOO MUCH WITHOUT ACTION, ETC.)

I was in the middle of writing a creative nonfiction piece for my writing class, a piece in which I recounted the details of the night my dad’s cancer took him violently to the other side, and in the piece I decided to throw in a line I was thinking but didn’t voice at the time: “Mom, I wish that were you.”

It wasn’t that my dad was just my hero, as I described him in my short elegy at my father’s funeral. It was that he was my protector. My mom had a rough childhood, cemented by my mom’s mom having had a rough childhood. It wasn’t her fault that we never got along. But here we were, together, without the mediator we had for all of my life. And I couldn’t explain my feelings in any other way than a simple trade. Give me my protector back, and maybe this wouldn’t hurt so bad.

Looking back on it, it was obvious that my first encounter, checking the “drain emotions” box wasn’t going to work. There was too much processing going on. It reminds me of the first computers, which took days to calculate the sum of a simple numerical equation. There were gears and levers, machinated processing that worked and churned until it could make out what it needed. My emotions were still processing.

Over the next few years, I had fallen deeper and deeper into my confused, adulterated world. I was in a happy relationship, which kept me sane. I had a number of jobs, though none lasted very long, and I was very far from what one would could call “finding my purpose”. Anxiety was the focal point of life — I would survive an outing with family, or even friends. I swore off drinking and smoking, not out of appreciation for my health, but out of fear of losing control, or worse, of losing my life. I had become afraid of everything, especially everything that could go wrong with my health. My dad was only 48 when he passed. His last day of chemotherapy ended, and hours later, his immune system was too shot to fight off common infection. Purely out of fear, I decided in each moment that I needed to know what could go wrong, so I could avoid it. I couldn’t last in a car for too long without panicking. I was terrified of flying. I wouldn’t allow myself to have a good time — I was simply too afraid to.

My story personally feels unique, though I know it’s far from it. If you’re reading this and stumble on something in my story you relate to in your current life, I want to help answer this question for you: why did therapy work for me? And as a follow-up: what else worked for me? And maybe, for fun: where am I now (in every sense)?

…

Michael Scott from *The Office said “*Sometimes I start a sentence, and I don’t even know where it’s going. I just hope I find it along the way”.

This is how I am. I process my thoughts primarily through talk. Though I’m introverted by nature, I find that talking out loud helps me to discover my own thoughts on something. It’s not that I don’t think straight or clearly, or that thoughts aren’t happening before I talk. I’m a nice guy, and I don’t say rude or unpleasant things to people out of a kind of “radical truth” principle that I have no choice but to live. I really just find that I think a lot, that I live in my thoughts, that I’m very creative and my thoughts meander and transform in rapid sequence, and many time out of sequence altogether.

I’ve tried writing, and journaling, and listening to others to help make sense of my thoughts and emotions. But nothing worked until I was ready to talk, ready to commit my feelings in the open air space, and share them with someone else in good faith. I let down my guard and let it all go. Talking allowed me to do that.

One important trait I share with my mom is that we like to talk, and that we process our thoughts through this medium. I’ve come to appreciate this about myself, and recognizing this is as important to my wellbeing as anything else I’ve come to understand in life.

But talking doesn’t work for everyone. I’m under no illusion that you process thoughts or emotions the way I do. There’s a wild tangle of emotions caught up in aspiring logic in my brain, though my wife, for example, can find herself in deep thought without recognizing it.

Talking works for her much more so by listening to someone she respects tell her like it is, helping her to discover her internal processing. It’s not through her own words that she can recognize her emotions, but by something or someone external.

Others, by contrast, I’ve come to know understand themselves and their thought processes by writing. But it’s not the writing that enables me access to the thoughts and emotions I want to get to and make sense of, but rather the inherent questions posed during the act of writing. Writing this long form, for example, has caused me to … To 10x my approach, I speak a lot of it out loud, often with my wife listening and offering advice. For me, her advice isn’t what I need. Her being there while I talk is what I need. It jars loose the mental processing that works for me…

SO, what’s the goal? To clarify your thinking and unravel the emotions you’re attached to but perhaps can’t access.

SO, what are your options?

1. Talking to someone, a professional. Audible or “spoken word” discovery. If you can’t afford it, start by calling friends. Just bullshit along until you can confide anything in them. Talk to someone you can cry to. Keep alcohol out of it — that’s not access. You can also try talking into an audio app or microphone, and listening to it. You often won’t have to listen back to it afterward, as most of the discovery comes from talking it out of you.
2. Writing. In a physical or digital journal, typing in an empty document. This
3. Writing, as advice. I’m just as annoyed as anyone is by the influx of “how to” or advice articles that would fit under the “self-help” label. However, just as the Feynman technique (see *here*) facilitates your organizing information for deeper understanding, it can work for your emotions as well. Think through what is ailing you, start with either a prompt
4. Drawing, painting, sculpting. Don’t fear the subconscious. Flow matters. Your brain is working on the things that matter to you . Think about it, absorb yourself in something, then think about it again.
5. Moving, physically.
6. Meditating.

The important part of all of these is that they involve output. You have to put things out there in order to discover what’s inside. When you’re overwhelmed with thoughts or emotions, it’s often too difficult to think your way through a problem. These problems are internal. It’s much simpler to think through how to build a puzzle on your kitchen table, solve a crossword puzzle, or even Google until you figure out how to fix the bug in your code. But

Writing, speaking, moving, lifting, hitting, crafting, making/creating, small talk, speeches, money on the line, put your brain where your mouth is, etc.

How do you know if it’s working?
